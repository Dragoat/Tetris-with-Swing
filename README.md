# Tetris-with-Swing

This project is a Tetris recreation using Java Swing and JFrame. The recreation should have a start-up menu, have four separate block types, different levels, allow you to record your score, and allow you to quit the game from the menu.

### The goals of this project:

1. Gain a better knowledge of GUI and how it is applied in Java
2. Create a better understanding of Swing
3. Create a better understanding of what Java methods can do with GUIs, and how methods interact with them
4. To create a working Tetris game that can be shared on other computers, not just the one it was created on
